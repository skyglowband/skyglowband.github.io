					<h1>1. Sacred Self-Deceit</h1>
					Welcome to the kingdom<br/>
					Of a sacred self-deceit<br/>
					Where people give up freedom<br/>
					For ostentatious majesty<br/>
					For their masters' use<br/>
					They hide in a fictive world<br/>
					Afraid to see the truth<br/>
					And the atrocities it holds<br/>
					<br/>
					You who turn our life into a living hell<br/>
					Selfish and obsessed with wealth<br/>
					Your minds are too weak to get<br/>
					One day your black feast will end<br/>
					<br/>
					Your illusionary justice<br/>
					Is a triumph of hypocrisy<br/>
					The law protects the bashers<br/>
					In the service of autocracy<br/>
					Those who dare to disagree<br/>
					Are thrown to rot in prison<br/>
					Forget the liberty<br/>
					And fall deep into fascism<br/>
					<br/>
					If every time you see an outrage<br/>
					Neglecting is all you do<br/>
					No one will come to your aid<br/>
					When it happens to you<br/>
					<br/>
					<small>* Russia is among the 50 countries with the worst corruption perception index. Almost all of the country's top leaders are corrupt and are not afraid to expose their super-rich state. At the same time, 15% of the population of Russia is below the poverty line.<br/>
					* In Russia, opposition activists are persecuted, people are regularly imprisoned for publishing opposition and anti-religious materials. In the rating of press freedom, Russia is also on one of the last 50 places.<br/>
					* In 2015, the approval rating of the current president Putin, who rules the country over the last 18 years, almost reached 90%.</small><br/>
					<br/>

					<h1>2. Limitless Fog of Anguish</h1>
					With every daybreak horror is what he meets<br/>
					When eyes are opened the real nightmare begins<br/>
					His frail skin is torn away by slightest graze<br/>
					Infernal pain impales his body with every pace<br/>
					<br/>
					Sentenced before birth to early death in a sea of pain<br/>
					Doomed to suffer forever chained in fetters of decay<br/>
					<br/>
					Lingering agony, dreadful world, somber and steeped in despair<br/>
					Fate that was chosen by your god, a mission that he prepared<br/>
					Innocent child lost in a sullen kingdom of woe<br/>
					A land where the dim light of goodness is fading into the fog<br/>
					<br/>
					Result of fear and ignorance imposed from the above<br/>
					Hypocrites don't care about the consequence of their lie<br/>
					Who needs his pain, what does he suffer for?<br/>
					Begetting him they gave him dreams just to watch them rot<br/>
					<br/>
					As mob of feeble-minded hides from the truth in self-deceit<br/>
					In the kingdom of delusion if you're distressed then you do not exist<br/>
					<br/>
					As years went by his hope was dying out<br/>
					Bitter hate has turned to ember his martyr heart<br/>
					With the hope he lost the reason to endure<br/>
					What they must've done he finally will do<br/>
					He'll close the gate between this hell and earth<br/>
					Without fear into the darkness he'll go<br/>
					<br/>
					Limitless fog of anguish and grief<br/>
					<br/>
					<small>* Up to 10 oncology patients in Russia per month commit suicide due to the lack of painkillers. Euthanasia is legislatively forbidden in Russia.<br/>
					* In Russia children are left without parental care 4 times more often than in Europe and the USA. In 2013 Russia has prohibited the USA citizens to adopt Russian children.<br/>
					* Russian Orthodox Church promotes the prohibition of abortion, and the government makes attempts to prohibit abortion on a federal level.</small><br/>
					<br/>

					<h1>3. Losing Humanity</h1>
					Look at what you are,<br/>
					An unfeeling rabid beast<br/>
					What's left inside your heart?<br/>
					Is there some place for empathy?<br/>
					Why don't you free your mind<br/>
					Of this needless thirst for blood?<br/>
					When will you realize<br/>
					That people are all alike?<br/>
					<br/>
					Damned be the rulers<br/>
					That make up this heinous lie<br/>
					Inducing our people<br/>
					To kill and to die<br/>
					Forget the false borders<br/>
					And all those pretentious names<br/>
					Get rid of this drivel<br/>
					Stop playing their games<br/>
					<br/>
					Flame of war burns brighter<br/>
					With each life it takes<br/>
					Widening its boundaries<br/>
					Of devoured space<br/>
					Spreading like a viral<br/>
					Terminal desease<br/>
					Grinding into powder<br/>
					All that it can seize<br/>
					<br/>
					They've planted an idea<br/>
					That they know more than you<br/>
					Enforced their fake ideals<br/>
					Telling you what to do<br/>
					They want you to forget<br/>
					The notions of good and evil<br/>
					Justifying the death<br/>
					Of an innocent human being<br/>
					<br/>
					<small>* During the Second World War, about 10 million soldiers and 18 million civilians were killed in the USSR (altogether 14% of the country's population).<br/>
					* In 2014, Russia invaded the neighboring state of Ukraine and forcibly seized part of its territory. There is still a military conflict supported by Russia on Ukrainian territory.<br/>
					* Russia is actively promoting militarism and incite citizens against other countries.</small><br/>

					<h1>4. Thousand Years of Terror</h1>
					It's time to tell the truth explaining all<br/>
					The greatest tragedy we've ever known<br/>
					That marked the end of our history<br/>
					And the beginning of the era of misery<br/>
					<br/>
					One man who thought he was a deity<br/>
					Invoked a dark and alien entity<br/>
					That spread so swiftly as a firestorm<br/>
					Destroying every form of art and free thought<br/>
					<br/>
					Raping our culture,<br/>
					Killing our people<br/>
					Setting a new order<br/>
					Of total submission<br/>
					<br/>
					Fall, kneel, bow, obey!<br/>
					Concede, conform, disown, DIE!!!<br/>
					<br/>
					We will burn all that's dear to you,<br/>
					We'll enslave your native land<br/>
					Leaving you to dwell in grief<br/>
					Through the thousand years of terror<br/>
					<br/>
					From this day forth our life turned into hell<br/>
					Our nation was cursed, when the righteous warriors fell<br/>
					As torture went on we were forced to humility<br/>
					Soon our hope was gone, lost in the sombre infinity<br/>
					<br/>
					They have burnt all that's dear to us<br/>
					They've enslaved our native land<br/>
					We were doomed to dwell in grief<br/>
					Through the thousand years of terror<br/>
					<br/>
					They took our life!<br/>
					<br/>
					<small>* In 988 knyaz Vladimir I chose Orthodox Christianity as a state religion of Rus. The christening was forcible, with killing of those who refused.<br/>
					* Our pre-christian culture was prohibited and severely destroyed. The only remaining source of information about it is the christian chronicles.<br/>
					* Up to the 17th century there was almost no culture or science in Russia except for the church. The first university was found in 1724.</small><br/>
					<br/>

					<h1>5. A New Age</h1>
					Once again the dark has gripped this ill-fated land<br/>
					Famine, war, diseases, unnecessary pain<br/>
					Something has to be done to find a way<br/>
					Out of this destiny's sinister maze<br/>
					<br/>
					Tension is growing, patience is running out<br/>
					People are ready waiting for a command to start<br/>
					Seems that the story will soon come to an end<br/>
					Culprits can not escape the punishment<br/>
					<br/>
					Years of despair have blackened their hearts,<br/>
					Now they feel no remorse<br/>
					Only one thing is left in their minds<br/>
					A desire to kill their lords<br/>
					<br/>
					Change of epochs brings hope, but was this one true?<br/>
					Their past insanity is now replaced by a new<br/>
					Once they get the power, oppressed start to oppress<br/>
					Dissidents will become food for the human thirst for death<br/>
					<br/>
					A new age of slavery has begun<br/>
					Starting the script once again<br/>
					No escape from this endless circle<br/>
					Of human pain<br/>
					<br/>
					PAIN!<br/>
					<br/>
					<small>* In 1917 owing to inadequate actions of emperor Nicholas II, the Civil War broke out, obliterating the lifes of more than 10 million people.<br/>
					* The Bolsheviks who came to power carried out mass repressions, known as the Red Terror, during which in 1917-1921 2 million people were killed.<br/>
					* During the 1930s and 1940s, massive Stalinist repressions were carried out, as a result of which more than 1.5 million people were shot and 3.5 million were sent to labor camps. More than 6 million people also died of starvation in the 1930s.</small><br/>
