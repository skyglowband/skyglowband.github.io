					<h1>1. Sacred Self-Deceit</h1>
					Welcome to the kingdom<br/>
					Of a sacred self-deceit<br/>
					Where people give up freedom<br/>
					For ostentatious majesty<br/>
					For their masters' use<br/>
					They hide in a fictive world<br/>
					Afraid to see the truth<br/>
					And the atrocities it holds<br/>
					<br/>
					You who turn our life into a living hell<br/>
					Selfish and obsessed with wealth<br/>
					Your minds are too weak to get<br/>
					One day your black feast will end<br/>
					<br/>
					Your illusionary justice<br/>
					Is a triumph of hypocrisy<br/>
					The law protects the bashers<br/>
					In the service of autocracy<br/>
					Those who dare to disagree<br/>
					Are thrown to rot in prison<br/>
					Forget the liberty<br/>
					And fall deep into fascism<br/>
					<br/>
					If every time you see an outrage<br/>
					Neglecting is all you do<br/>
					No one will come to your aid<br/>
					When it happens to you<br/>
					<br/>
					* Russia is among the 50 countries with the worst corruption perception index. Almost all of the country's top leaders are corrupt and are not afraid to expose their super-rich state. At the same time, 15% of the population of Russia is below the poverty line.<br/>
					* In Russia, opposition activists are persecuted, people are regularly imprisoned for publishing opposition and anti-religious materials. In the rating of press freedom, Russia is also on one of the last 50 places.<br/>
					* In 2015, the approval rating of the current president Putin, who rules the country over the last 18 years, had almost reached 90%.<br/>
