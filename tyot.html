					<h1>1. Sacred Self-Deceit</h1>
					Welcome to the kingdom<br/>
					Of a sacred self-deceit<br/>
					Where people give up freedom<br/>
					For ostentatious majesty<br/>
					For their masters' use<br/>
					They hide in a fictive world<br/>
					Afraid to see the truth<br/>
					And the atrocities it holds<br/>
					<br/>
					You who turn our life into a living hell<br/>
					Selfish and obsessed with wealth<br/>
					Your minds are too weak to get<br/>
					One day your black feast will end<br/>
					<br/>
					Your illusionary justice<br/>
					Is a triumph of hypocrisy<br/>
					The law protects the bashers<br/>
					In the service of autocracy<br/>
					Those who dare to disagree<br/>
					Are thrown to rot in prison<br/>
					Forget the liberty<br/>
					And fall deep into fascism<br/>
					<br/>
					If every time you see an outrage<br/>
					Neglecting is all you do<br/>
					No one will come to your aid<br/>
					When it happens to you<br/>
					<br/>
					* Russia is among the 50 countries with the worst corruption perception index. Almost all of the country's top leaders are corrupt and are not afraid to expose their super-rich state. At the same time, 15% of the population of Russia is below the poverty line.<br/>
					* In Russia, opposition activists are persecuted, people are regularly imprisoned for publishing opposition and anti-religious materials. In the rating of press freedom, Russia is also on one of the last 50 places.<br/>
					* In 2015, the approval rating of the current president Putin, who rules the country over the last 18 years, had almost reached 90%.<br/>

					<h1>2. Limitless Fog of Anguish</h1>
					With every daybreak horror is what he meets<br/>
					When eyes are opened the real nightmare begins<br/>
					His frail skin is torn away by slightest graze<br/>
					Infernal pain impales his body with every pace<br/>
					<br/>
					Sentenced before birth to early death in a sea of pain<br/>
					Doomed to suffer forever chained in fetters of decay<br/>
					<br/>
					Lingering agony, dreadful world, somber and steeped in despair<br/>
					Fate that was chosen by your god, a mission that he prepared<br/>
					Innocent child lost in a sullen kingdom of woe<br/>
					A land where the dim light of goodness is fading into the fog<br/>
					<br/>
					Result of fear and ignorance imposed from the above<br/>
					Hypocrites don't care about the consequence of their lie<br/>
					Who needs his pain, what does he suffer for?<br/>
					Begetting him they gave him dreams just to watch them rot<br/>
					<br/>
					As mob of feeble-minded hides from the truth in self-deceit<br/>
					In the kingdom of delusion if you're distressed then you do not exist<br/>
					<br/>
					As years went by his hope was dying out<br/>
					Bitter hate has turned to ember his martyr heart<br/>
					With the hope he lost the reason to endure<br/>
					What they must've done he finally will do<br/>
					He'll close the gate between this hell and earth<br/>
					Without fear into the darkness he'll go<br/>
					<br/>
					Limitless fog of anguish and grief<br/>
					<br/>
					* Up to 10 oncology patients in Russia per month commit suicide due to the lack of painkillers. Euthanasia is legislatively forbidden in Russia.<br/>
					* In Russia children are left without parental care 4 times more often than in Europe and the USA. In 2013 Russia has prohibited the USA citizens to adopt Russian children.<br/>
					* Russian Orthodox Church promotes the prohibition of abortion, and the government makes attempts to prohibit abortion on a federal level.<br/>
